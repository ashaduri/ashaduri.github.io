# Intro

I have been a professional C++ software developer since 2002. While I firmly believe in using the right tool for the
job, I am also deeply committed to safe, reliable, and efficient programming. My primary interests lie in developing
secure C++ and Rust code. Most of my software is cross-platform, although I primarily use Linux as my desktop and
development platform.

# Free Software Projects

This is a partial list of free software projects that I have developed.

## [GSmartControl](https://gsmartcontrol.shaduri.dev)

***Hard disk drive and SSD health inspection tool***

GSmartControl is an open-source, cross-platform application for inspecting the health of hard disk drives and SSDs. It
supports all major desktop operating systems, including Linux, Windows, macOS, FreeBSD, and other BSD-style systems.

The latest Windows version has been downloaded over **425,000 times**.

GSmartControl is also included in most Linux distributions (Fedora, openSUSE, Ubuntu, Mint, Debian) and FreeBSD.

Reviews and copies of GSmartControl have been published in multiple issues of **c't Magazin**, a computer magazine with
the most subscribers in Europe.

See the code at [github.com/ashaduri/gsmartcontrol](https://github.com/ashaduri/gsmartcontrol).

## [Csv::Parser](https://github.com/ashaduri/csv-parser)

***Compile-time and runtime CSV parser library written in C++17***

Csv::Parser is an RFC 4180-compliant CSV parser library written in C++17.
It leverages modern C++ features to provide a simple, extendable API, supporting zero-runtime-overhead
resource loading through compile-time parsing. The library is thoroughly tested using Catch2.

See the code at [github.com/ashaduri/csv-parser](https://github.com/ashaduri/csv-parser).


## [Qt-ccTalk](https://github.com/ashaduri/qt-cctalk)

***ccTalk protocol implementation in modern C++ / Qt***

ccTalk is a binary serial protocol widely used in the money transaction and point-of-sale industry for communication
with bill validators and coin acceptors.

The Qt-ccTalk library offers a high-level, type-safe, asynchronous C++ API for ccTalk, adhering to the ccTalk Serial
Communication Protocol Specification. It utilizes Qt for thread management and message passing, ensuring thread-safe,
non-blocking communication with multiple ccTalk devices.

Additionally, Qt-ccTalk includes a GUI application for inspecting the protocol channel and testing ccTalk devices.
