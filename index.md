***Professional C++ and Rust Developer***

## Intro

I'm a professional C++ software developer since 2002. While I strongly believe in using the right tool for the job, I'm also an avid fan of safe, reliable and efficient programming, so safe C++ and Rust code is where my interests are focused. Most of my software is cross-platform, but I mainly use Linux as my desktop and development platform.
